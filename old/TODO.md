[ ] make ReactTerminal work with whatever needed for this portfoli site
[ ] make it reusable and distribute as open-source

STEPS:
[/] blinking input	=> default input cursor is blinking already :D
[-] command History object
	[/] using an object as a data structure, set in setState
	[?] performance issues with this? 
	[ ] check out immutability-helper: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27105257/storing-an-object-in-state-of-a-react-component

[/] fix branching and deployment finally
	- dev branch for well, "dev"
	- built public dir deploys to master branch, 
	which is read by lenmorld.github.io by default (can't even change it)

[ ] click anywhere to type in the command input


[ ] matrix effect

	[ ] - Level 1: canvas animation
		[/] - working animation
		[ ] - make input usable

	[ ] - Level 2: pure css?

	[ ] - React component, keeping Character, Line and Matrix in state
		--> too laggy

		[ ] solve movement problem
			[ ] TODO: practice scrolling div from top to bottom, then continues to top


[ ] REDO IT ALL. MAKE IT SIMPLE!
