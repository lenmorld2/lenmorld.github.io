				Use your fucking hands. To surpass others is fucking tough, if you only do as you are told you don’t have it
				in you to succeed. Saul Bass on failure: Failure is built into creativity… the creative act involves this
				element of ‘newness’ and ‘experimentalism,’ then one must expect and accept the fucking possibility of
				failure. While having drinks with Tibor Kalman one night, he told me, “When you make something no one hates,
				no one fucking loves it.” Form follows fucking function. You won’t get good at anything by doing it a lot
				fucking aimlessly. Creativity is a fucking work-ethic. To go partway is easy, but mastering anything
				requires hard fucking work. Paul Rand once said, “The public is more familiar with bad fucking design than
				good design.
